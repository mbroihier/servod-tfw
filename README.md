# tfw-template - Test Framework Template

This repository contains a test framework template that I'm using to create test documentation for my projects.  My GITHUB repository, tfw, contains a superset of these tools and white papers describing philosophies that have inspired this framework.  Although this framework is somewhat focused around a manual testing process, the roots of it are based on systems where I've had system simulators and emulations that automatically generated the test cases.  The base framework tools were used to translate the test case database created by the simulators/emulatored into documentation to report testing status and to help developers understand the tests that were failing so that they could debug problems.  The tools within this repository have been modified from the copies in tfw to work with the directory structure used by Heroku.  During the developement of my personal projects, I run this framework locally on my Macs.

See my rtnv-tfw repository to see how this template is used.

https://rtnv-tfw.herokuapp.com runs a deployment of the rtnv-tfw repository to illustrate capabilities.
